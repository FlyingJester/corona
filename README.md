Corona Image I/O Library

Copyright 2002 Chad Austin

This is a MODIFIED version of Corona. It has been patched to work with
newer versions of libpng.

Corona is a convenient, high-level image loading and saving API.  It
lets you add support for loading and saving images in your application
very easily.
